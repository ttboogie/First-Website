# Living Wage Project

This project is the very first website I created, and it explores an important topic: the **living wage**. This website provides information about the history of the living wage, insights into the living wage in the Bay Area, and resources for further learning and ways to support the cause.

While this was my first website, it marks the beginning of my journey into computer science. Creating something meaningful with just my hands and my computer helped me realize the power of technology to inform and impact society. My skills have grown significantly since then, but I’m proud to showcase this project as the foundation of my CS journey.

## Project Overview

The website covers several aspects of the living wage:

- **Living Wage Overview**: An introduction to what a living wage is and why it's essential for a fair and sustainable society.
- **Historical Background**: A brief history of the living wage movement and its evolution over time.
- **Bay Area Insights**: An exploration of living wage statistics and challenges specific to the Bay Area, a region known for its high cost of living.
- **Resources and Actions**: Links to resources for learning more, organizations to support, and ways to contribute, including donation options.

## Why It Matters

This project highlights the importance of a living wage and the impact it has on individuals, families, and communities. Understanding the need for fair wages is critical in addressing economic inequality, and this website serves as a small educational tool to raise awareness and promote action.

## Personal Significance

This project was my introduction to web development, and creating it sparked my interest in computer science. Seeing the website come to life gave me a sense of accomplishment and a newfound passion for building things that can make a difference. Since then, I have honed my skills, but this project remains a reminder of where I started and why I chose this path.

## How to Explore the Project

To view the project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The website is simple yet impactful, reflecting my early steps in learning web development.

## Future Plans

While I don’t plan to update this project, I keep it as a milestone and a symbol of my growth in tech. My skills have evolved, but this project will always represent the beginning of my journey in creating meaningful digital experiences.

Please remember that it was created as a personal educational project and does not reflect current web development practices.
