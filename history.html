      		<p>In 1675, Boston ship carpenters banded together to demand a raise in pay. In 1886,  the American Federation of Labor was formed. Their goal was to create a “living wage” that would provide for workers to “maintain an ‘American standard of living’ higher than the 19th century European urban working class. This living wage applied to all workers, even those not in a union. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed to create the first national minimum wage at $0.25 an hour. The labor force worked to continue the increase of the minimum wage and by World War II it was up to $1.60/hour which is equal to $11.20 in 2017, but over time the minimum wage could no longer sustain and declined to $7.25/hour in 2017.</p>

      <h3>The Living Wage Today</h3>
      		<p>Today, the minimum wage is not enough to pay off the cost of living, and has not been since the 1960s. The minimum wage was created with the intention of a living wage, but over time that has been proven to be ineffective. If the minimum wage had increased at the rate of infection, it would have had to be up to $10.15 in 2018. Currently, the minimum wage of $7.25/hour falls below the poverty line, which clearly does not live up to its current goal of providing citizens with the “American standard of living”.</p>
